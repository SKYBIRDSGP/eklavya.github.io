### Project Description
You must have seen the quadruped robots built by Stanford, MIT, IIT Kanpur, etc. These Quadrupeds are way better than the wheeled robots for the navigation and are robust for being used for survellience. Quadrupeds are becoming famous due to their high stability margin and robustness.Through this project, we intend to make a similar robot-VJTI's Quadruped : Titan.<br>

The project aims to design and build a robot from scratch, focusing on the development of a quadruped. Mentees will embark on a comprehensive journey exploring and studying various mechanisms essential for leg movement. Following this, they will utilize CAD modeling software such as SOLIDWORKS, ONSHAPE, or FUSION360, depending on their preference, to assemble the quadruped meticulously.<br>

Additionally, mentees will conduct a detailed analysis to assess the feasibility and strength of the designed components. The manufacturing process will involve advanced techniques like 3D printing and laser cutting, ensuring precision and efficiency simultaneously delving into ROS2 for both simulation and control aspects of the robot, fostering a holistic understanding of robotic systems. <br>
